Detailed Train Directory Meowalization for README
-------------------------------------------------

+----------------------+
| train/ (Directory)   |
| 'Purpose: Contains scripts and tools for training and running the HelloGPT model.' |
+----------------------+
|
|-- train.py
|   'Purpose: Main script for training the HelloGPT model.'
|   'Relation: Central to the directory, orchestrates the entire training process using other components.'
|-- train.yaml
|   'Purpose: YAML file containing configurations for the training process.'
|   'Relation: Provides configurable parameters read by train.py.'
|
|
|-- model_runner.py
|   'Purpose: Script for running the HelloGPT model, typically for inference or testing.'
|   'Relation: Utilizes config_helper.py and hardware_controller.py for setup.'
|-- model_run.yaml
|   'Purpose: YAML file containing configurations for running the model.'
|   'Relation: Read by model_runner.py for runtime configurations.'
|
|
|-- config_helper.py
|   'Purpose: Manages and helps in the configuration of the training process.'
|   'Relation: loads yaml files into dictionaries, supports overrides of one config with another.'
|
|-- data_controller.py
|   'Purpose: Handles data loading, batching, and preprocessing for training.'
|   'Relation: Essential for providing data to the model during training in train.py.'
|
|-- hardware_controller.py
|   'Purpose: Manages hardware settings and optimizations for training.'
|   'Relation: Used in train.py and model_runner.py to ensure optimal hardware usage.'
|
|-- monitoring_controller.py
|   'Purpose: Monitors training progress, logs metrics, and handles checkpoints.'
|   'Relation: Integrates with train.py to oversee training process and outcomes.'


* Notes for README:
  - The 'train' directory encapsulates the functionality required for training the HelloGPT model.
  - It includes configuration files, controllers for data and hardware, and scripts for training and running the model.
  - Understanding the role of each file in this directory is crucial for effective training and management of the HelloGPT model.
